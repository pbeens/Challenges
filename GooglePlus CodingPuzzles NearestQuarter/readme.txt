In response to a challenge at https://plus.google.com/u/0/117020778736538274606/posts/GiTCpXZxLdG

"You need to round to the nearest quarter percent.  So if I had 2.11 then it would round to 2.00, or if I had 1.23 it would round to 1.25, and if you had 3.97 it turns into 4.00."

My solution has been written as a Python doctest.
